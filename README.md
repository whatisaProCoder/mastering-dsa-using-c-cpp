# Mastering DSA using C and C++
This was my introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++. This is a course on Udemy which builds the foundation to move into intermediate and industry-level DSA by using the simplest inbuilt functions, libraries and pointers in C. It helped me transition smoothly into Strivers A2Z DSA Course. Using this course, I made a good grasp on how to work with pointers and deal with its edge-cases.
